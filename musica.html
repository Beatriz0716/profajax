            <h3>Letra</h3>
            La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la<br>
            <br>
            Look, I don't wanna fight you<br>
            You got to know that I meant it<br>
            When I said that I liked you<br>
            Or maybe just the idea<br>
            I bought it, don't want it, now return that shit like IKEA<br>
            <br>
            Apologize, I'm not a mind reader<br>
            I need attention, so I try to be a crowd pleaser<br>
            It was easy 'til it got a little deeper<br>
            Now I don't know how to deal with you<br>
            So I'ma disappear (poof)<br>
            <br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            Now you see me, now you don't<br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            Every time you hit the phone<br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la)<br>
            Now you see me, now you don't<br>
            (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la)<br>
            <br>
            Ayy, I know it's inconvenient<br>
            To change your background but let's back down<br>
            So you can see this is a problem<br>
            I don't wanna put myself in front of<br>
            That's why I blocked you 'cause I'm not the guy you should rely on<br>
            <br>
            Or spy on, creep on, I don't know<br>
            You just ain't that type of hoe<br>
            If I don't holler, let me go<br>
            I should've said it but I didn't and I won't (poof)<br>
            <br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            Now you see me, now you don't<br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            Every time you hit the phone<br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la)<br>
            Now you see me, now you don't<br>
            (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la)<br>
            <br>
            I know you hate me, hate me, hate me, hate me, hate me<br>
            'Cause I been shady, shady, shady, shady, shady<br>
            I don't get reception<br>
            I missed your call but best believe I got the message<br>
            <br>
            Why don't you just leave me alone?<br>
            I think it's lasted way too long<br>
            I thought by now that you would know<br>
            But since you don't<br>
            <br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            Now you see me, now you don't<br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            Every time you hit the phone<br>
            I'm a ghost<br>
            (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la)<br>
            Now you see me, now you don't<br>
            (La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la)<br>

            You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out<br>
            <br>
            Yeah<br>
            The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim<br>
            Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim<br>
            So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim<br>
            World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim<br>
            I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
            I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah<br>
            Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim<br>
            So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim<br>
            <br>
            Pop a couple pills in the daytime<br>
            Heard you got a friend, what's her head like?<br>
            Probably should've fucked on the first night<br>
            Now I gotta wait for the green light<br>
            I don't wanna wait for no green light<br>
            Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright<br>
            Luckily I float at insane heights<br>
            Luckily, luckily, luckily, yeah<br>
            <br>
            Location drop, now<br>
            Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now<br>
            Oh, what a cop out<br>

            <br>
            Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip<br>
            Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip, no<br>
            I know I said I'd call, I never did, no<br>
            (Swim) swim, swim now<br>
            I can take you, even though I've never been there<br>
            The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again now<br>
            I've been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in, girl<br>
            <br>

            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows<br>
            For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground<br>
            I'm searching to behold the stories that are told<br>
            When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned<br>
            <br>       
            Tell you: You're the greatest<br>
            But once you turn, they hate us<br>
            <br>        
            Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            My enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            But I'm ready<br>
            <br>        
            Your words up on the wall as you'rе praying for my fall<br>
            And the laughter in thе halls<br>
            And the names that I've been called<br>
            I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time<br>
            When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic<br>
            <br>        
            Tell you: You're the greatest<br>
            But once you turn, they hate us<br>
            <br>        
            Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            My enemy-y-y-y-y (yeah)<br>
            (Look out for yourself)<br>
            <br>        
            Uh, look, okay<br>
            I'm hoping that somebody pray for me<br>
            I'm praying that somebody hope for me<br>
            I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be<br>
            P-p-posted, being a wreck of emotions<br>
            Ready to go whenever just let me know<br>
            The road is long so put the pedal into the floor<br>
            The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable<br>
            I'ma tell 'em: Hasta luego<br>
            They wanna plot on my trot to the top<br>
            I've been outta shape, thinking out the box I'm an astronaut<br>
            I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe<br>
            And it matters more because I had it not<br>
            Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition<br>
            Kinda shockin' they wanted a static with precision I'm automatic quaterback<br>
            I ain't talking sacking, pack it, pack it up, I don't panic<br>
            Batter, batter up, who the baddest?<br>
            It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat<br>
            <br>        
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Oh, the misery<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            Spare the sympathy<br>
            Everybody wants to be my enemy<br>
            <br>        
            Pray it away, I swear<br>
            I'll never be a saint, no way<br>
            My enemy<br>
            Pray it away, I swear<br>
            I'll never be a saint<br>
